##Thermostat

###A User interface for a thermostat built with javascript
____________________

I worked on this project during week 6 at Makers Academy. It served as great practice in learning the basics of javascript, jquery, ajax calls, and css.
The whole project has been tested using jasmine and jasmine j-query.
The interface was developed in vanilla javascript first, then translated in jquery. The original js file is included for reference.

These are the functionalities:

- the temperature can be set and reset by clicking the relative buttons; 
- the temperature will change color based on its value;
- a power saving option can be enabled and disabled;
- weather information for the current city is provided by the weather api [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api)

NB: In order for the JQuery tests to work, you need to disable local file restrictions in your browser
